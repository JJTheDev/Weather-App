# Weather-App

## Description

This weather app will allow the user to view a 5 day forecast for the city of their choice, This is possible using the 
openweatherAPI. 
This will allow the user to understand what the weather will be for the next 5 days.
I learned that creating the API connection can require certian requirements. I enjoyed being able to use APIs it makes web development very easy instead of having to built the whole thing from the ground up. Ive come to learn that APIs are very very important.
